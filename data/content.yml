  title: 'ABOUT ME'

  content: "I bring my first master's degree in English education and **6+ years of experience as a product analyst in EdTech** to my second master’s degree in data science at Duke University. My expertise in curriculum design, user analysis, product design, and balancing data privacy with business needs, combined with my growing technical skills, has fueled my interest in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in EdTech and explainable technology**. 


           Driven by the technology challenges I encountered in my previous work, and by the difficulties I faced while transitioning from language education to data science, I hope to combine my work and learning experiences to research explainable technology and develop more accessible and user-friendly tools for learning advanced technologies. I am **actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Spring & Fall 2026**."
